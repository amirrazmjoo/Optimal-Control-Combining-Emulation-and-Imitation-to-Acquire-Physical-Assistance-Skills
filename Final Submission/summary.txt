This video shows how the experimental task (sit-to-stand (STS) transfer) is defined in this project. This task, in which a robot should help a human to stand from his/her sitting position, is defined with two optimization problems. The first one computes what is the optimal way to helo the human, and the second one controlles the robot to provide that assistance. This video also shows some examples of reproducing this task for different kind of disabilities.
